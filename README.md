# Note Taker App

## Description

With this straightforward application, you can create note entries effortlessly. Each entry comprises a title and its corresponding text. Once you have inputted a title and message, a save icon will become visible. By clicking on this icon, the note will be saved. The left column will display all of the saved note entries, and you can view their content by simply clicking on them. Additionally, if you wish to remove any entry, you can do so by clicking on the red trashcan icon located next to each entry.

By developing this application, I gained a deeper understanding of Express.js and acquired knowledge of various new concepts. It provided me with an opportunity to enhance my skills in handling GET and POST requests, as well as configuring an Express.js application to serve static files. Additionally, I gained insights into the relationship between client-side requests and server-side responses. Moreover, I expanded my knowledge by exploring the deployment process using Heroku, which offers more capabilities compared to GitHub which is limited to hosting static webpages without supporting server-side processing.
